# Getting started

whiteboard's canvas runs right in your browser. In **Browser-local** mode your
drawings live in your own browser (IndexedDB) — no account, and nothing leaves
your machine while you work.

Today you run the browser app locally from a checkout. **Prerequisites:** Node.js
and pnpm (run `corepack enable` if you don't already have pnpm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamiazya/whiteboard.git
cd whiteboard      # pnpm workspace root — required for catalog: dependency resolution
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @kamiazya/whiteboard-web dev   # open http://localhost:5173
```

The page mounts a full Excalidraw canvas. Pick the rectangle tool from the
toolbar (or press `r`) and draw a shape, then reload the tab — the shape is
still there. That's your canvas persisting to IndexedDB in your own browser,
with no server and no account. Draw, close the tab, and come back later: the
same canvas is right where you left it. Pasted or uploaded images persist the
same way — reload the tab and they're still on the canvas.

**Where to go next:** want your AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) to draw with
you, or durable canvases as files on disk? That's the **Local daemon** — see
[Quick install](../../README.md#quick-install). Curious how whiteboard scales from a
browser tab to a self-hosted team server? See [the runtime modes](../explanation/).
