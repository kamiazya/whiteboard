# Getting started

whiteboard's canvas runs right in your browser. In **Browser-local** mode your
drawings live in your own browser (IndexedDB) — no account, and nothing leaves
your machine while you work.

Today you run the browser app locally from a checkout. **Prerequisites:** Node.js
and pnpm (run `corepack enable` if you don't already have pnpm).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kamiazya/whiteboard.git
cd whiteboard/apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # open http://localhost:5173
```

This is a minimal browser-local canvas: click **Add rectangle** to add an element
and watch the counter go up, then reload the tab — the elements are still there.
That's your canvas persisting in your own browser, with no server and no account.

**Where to go next:** want your AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) to draw with
you, or durable canvases as files on disk? That's the **Local daemon** — see
[Quick install](../../README.md#quick-install). Curious how whiteboard scales from a
browser tab to a self-hosted team server? See [the runtime modes](../explanation/).
